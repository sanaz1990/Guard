# Guard
Guard is a secure routing protocol for skip-graphs. It makes use of digital signature schemes and supervisor nodes called *guards* to assert the correctness during the lookup operations.
This particular implementation makes use of [jPBC library](http://gas.dia.unisa.it/projects/jpbc/) and a heavily modified version of the open-source SkipGraph implementation provided [here](https://github.com/yhassanzadeh13/SkipGraphNode).
## Layers
This implementation makes use of a layered architecture. From bottom to top, the layers for an authenticated node are as following:
1. **Communication layer:** Handles node-to-node communication.
2. **Authentication layer:** Implements the phases of Guard. Inserts & verifies the authentication meta-data related to authenticated search queries.
3. **Skip node layer:** Implements a skip-graph DHT node. Supports `search` and `join` operations.
4. **User interface:** Coordinates the authenticated/unauthenticated `search`, `join` operations. Per-node experiments are also handled by this layer.

Guard also makes use of a trusted third party (TTP) during the registration, construction and guard assignment phases. TTP also acts as the experiment controller. It is implemented as a separate application, and its layers are as following:
1. **Communication layer:** Handles TTP-to-node and node-to-TTP communication.
2. **TTP layer:** Contains the trusted third party protocols (e.g. registration) specific to Guard.
3. **TTP user interface:** Used to coordinate the experiment from a central point.

Each layer is implemented by extending the `Layer` abstract class. The specific layer implementations reside in their own packages.

## System parameters
The system parameters are defined under the `ttp` package, in `SystemParameters.java` file. System parameters are initialized at the TTP, and at the registration phase, they are transferred to the nodes. Here are the explanations of the parameters:
1. **SYSTEM_CAPACITY:** The number of nodes that the skip-graph contains. This implementation does not handle churn. In other words, `SYSTEM_CAPACITY` many nodes needs to register with the TTP before the lookups can be performed, and once joined, the nodes cannot depart from the system.
2. **IDENTITY_LENGTH:** Identity length for the digital signature scheme. This value should be larger than 256, as the messages are signed by two identities: name ID of a node, and the SHA-256 output of the numerical ID of a node.
3. **MESSAGE_LENGTH:** Message length for the digital signature scheme. This value denotes the length (in bytes) of the routing transcripts.
4. **NONCE_LENGTH:** Each lookup operation is assigned with a nonce, which is a random bit string. This denotes the length of the bit string.
5. **VERIFY_AT_INITIATOR:** Once this is set to true, the set of routing proofs received at the end of an authenticated search all are verified at the initiator of the search.
6. **VERIFY_AT_ROUTER:** Once this is set to true, each node in the search path verifies the routing proof generated by the previous node in the search path.

### Experiment parameters
We define an experiment in terms of *rounds*. An experiment is complete when each node successfully performs a pre-defined amount of rounds.
A *round* is defined as following
1. The node chooses a random numerical ID.
2. The node performs an unauthenticated search over the skip-graph for the chosen numerical ID.
3. The node performs an authenticated search over the skip-graph for the chosen numerical ID.

The parameters related to the experiment is also defined in the `SystemParameters.java` file: 
1. **ROUND_COUNT:** Denotes how many rounds a single node needs to complete.
2. **WAIT_TIME:** In order to avoid congestion, the nodes wait before proceeding to the next round. The waiting time (in seconds) is chosen uniformly from [0, `WAIT_TIME`].
